## Graphy

1. Once graph loaded, certain settings are not exchanged between elements of the program
1. Need to add a selection for heuristic calculation (euler and manhattan)

1. Need to add tilemap mode (using my engine tilemap)
2. will need to be able to adjust iterations (graph is sat at one or all) in auto mode as maps will contain much larger sets of nodes
